CoffeePhpBundle
===============

Symfony2 Bundle for using [alxlit's PHP implementation of the coffeescript compiler](https://github.com/alxlit/coffeescript-php). Good for using coffeescript in Symfony without having to install node.js as well.

If you're using Assetic without Symfony, the assetic filter located in Assetic/Filter should work fine as-is.
